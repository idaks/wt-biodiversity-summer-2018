### Refer to the following files or folder for latest progress:
1. Magnolia_all.ipynb for species co-occurence distribution visualization function. 

2. Refer to Magnolia folder for the Euler/x taxonomy alignment use case. 

3. Download the plotdata.py if you want to run the species occurrence distribution visualization individually.

### Ideal Workflow:

```                                           
                                        Decide which species we want to examine

                      Domain experts (systematists) provide a 'concept mapping' table for taxonomies over time
